CYANUS (A Calculator for gamma-ray Yield Analysis of NeUtron Activations) is a MATLAB tool for calculating the energies and intensities of delayed gamma-ray released by neutron irradiated samples. 
The highlight of this program is that users could give any pointwise neutron spectrum and get the yield analysis rapidly. 

===Quick Start=============================
1. Add the folder "function" to matlab search path.
2. Simply run "cyanus()" in the command window of MATLAB, several input forms to run CYANUS will appear.
3. Results are saved to cyanus-output.mat in the working path. The variable "table_gamma" shows all the possible delayed gamma-rays and their count in the measurement time period.


As an elementary work for aiding the neutron activation analysis with complex neutron fields, CYANUS requires abundant tests to become reliable. We sincerely thank you for using and cross checking CYANUS. Any comments are welcome.
